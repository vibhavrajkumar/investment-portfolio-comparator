## Purpose and Functionality 

The goal of this project was to create a full stack web application to enable users to view information about their own investments and to be able to compare them with others', including the University of Illinois'. The application uses Flask for backend, HTML and Javascript for frontend, and uses MySQL hosted on GCP for the database. Currently, the application supports adding, deleting, and updating one's own investments to the database, viewing information about individual investments and aggregated information on portfolios, and running advanced queries on the data which display interesting information such as portfolios with high average stock prices.
